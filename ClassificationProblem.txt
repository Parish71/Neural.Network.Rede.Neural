Neural Network for Simple Classification Problem

Problem Statement:
This Python script demonstrates the use of a simple neural network to solve a binary classification problem. 
The goal is to classify a given input into one of two classes: "baixo" (low) or "alto" (high) 
Based on the output of a neuron with a tanh activation function.
